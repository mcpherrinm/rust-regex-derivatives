Regular Expression Derivatives in Rust
--------------------------------------

Regex derivatives due to Brzozowski.  Super neat!

So first version is a port of Matt Might's scheme to Rust. This takes the
derivatives as it matches.  Doesn't include the boolean operators.

Surprisingly to me, it's shorter than the Scheme version.
